When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    In as much as git is good to keep track of all files and their changes, they may be need to share your work with others', 
    collaborate and work with others, or to save your work online so that it you can access it from another system or 
    if your system is stolen or damaged, you can always recover your work. In all the above stated scenarios and many more,
    it is ideal to use remote repositories.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling or pushing changes from/to the remote repository is best suited manually because you determine when it is ideal 
    to commit, when it is ideal to share with others, and what to share.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    To fork a repo is to make a copy of another person's work with a need to contribute, to clone is to duplicate/download and have no 
    reference to contribute while branches is when you take a copy and give it a label to test/experiment new features and when
    they are good enough to be added back to the main code, they can easily be added.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
